🦵 BOW LEGS (Genu Varum) BIOMECHANICS:

📐 STRUCTURAL ALIGNMENT:
• Knees bow outward when standing
• Increased lateral knee joint space
• Tibiofemoral angle: >5-10° varus deviation
• Weight-bearing line passes lateral to knee center

🏃 RUNNING GAIT IMPACT:

1. HEEL STRIKE PHASE:
   • Lateral heel strike (supinated foot position)
   • Increased ground reaction force on lateral foot
   • Reduced shock absorption (rigid foot)
   • Forces transmitted up lateral leg

2. MIDSTANCE PHASE:
   • Poor foot pronation (stays supinated)
   • Lateral knee compartment compression
   • Increased tibiofibular stress
   • IT band tension increases

3. PUSH-OFF PHASE:
   • Power generation from lateral foot
   • Inefficient energy transfer
   • Increased peroneal muscle demand
   • Lateral ankle instability

⚡ FORCE VECTOR ANALYSIS:
• Ground reaction force: 2.5-3.0x body weight
• 60-70% concentrated on lateral knee compartment (normal: 50%)
• Increased varus moment at knee: +35% stress
• Lateral tibial plateau pressure: +40-50%

💪 MUSCLE ACTIVATION PATTERNS:
• Overactive: Tensor Fasciae Latae (TFL), IT band, Peroneals
• Underactive: Hip adductors, Vastus Medialis Oblique (VMO)
• Compensation: Lateral trunk lean during stance phase
• Energy cost: +8-12% compared to neutral alignment

🥾 FOOTWEAR STRATEGY FOR BOW LEGS:

❌ AVOID:
• Stability/motion-control shoes (worsen supination)
• Minimalist shoes (need cushioning for lateral stress)
• High-drop shoes (>10mm, reduces ankle mobility)

✅ RECOMMENDED:
• Neutral cushioned shoes (8-10mm drop)
• Moderate arch support (not high)
• Slight lateral wedging (orthotic consultation)
• Examples: 
  - Brooks Ghost (neutral, cushioned)
  - Nike Pegasus (balanced platform)
  - Asics Nimbus (high cushion, neutral)

🔧 CUSTOM ORTHOTIC CONSIDERATION:
• If severe (>10° varus): Lateral heel wedge (3-5mm)
• Medial arch support to encourage pronation
• Consult podiatrist for gait analysis

⏱️ TIMELINE:
• Weeks 1-4: Focus on cushioning (protect lateral structures)
• Weeks 5-8: Introduce neutral shoes with exercises
• Weeks 9-12: Consider orthotic if not improving
      ''',
      terrainModifications: '''
🏞️ TERRAIN STRATEGY FOR BOW LEGS:

⚠️ AVOID (First 4-6 Weeks):
• Cambered roads (lateral tilt worsens varus stress)
• Rocky/uneven trails (lateral ankle sprains)
• Steep downhills (increased lateral knee loading)
• Hard surfaces (concrete) - use track or soft trails

✅ OPTIMAL TERRAIN:
• Flat, even surfaces (track, treadmill)
• Grass or synthetic turf (shock absorption)
• Indoor track (consistent surface)
• Slight inclines OK (uphill reduces impact)

📅 PROGRESSION:
Week 1-4: 100% flat, soft surfaces only
Week 5-8: Introduce gentle trails, avoid cambered roads
Week 9-12: Progressive return to varied terrain
Week 12+: Full terrain variety with proper footwear

🏃 TRAINING MODIFICATIONS:
• Reduce weekly mileage by 20-30% during correction phase
• Avoid speed work until Week 8+ (high lateral forces)
• Cross-train with swimming/cycling (non-weight-bearing)
• Gradual return: Add 10% mileage per week after Week 6
