### Bot Response (Abbreviated):

🎯 How We Measure Cadence During Intervals

Great question! Let me explain our scientific approach.

📱 What Your Watch Shows:
Your Garmin/COROS/Apple Watch calculates cadence across the
*entire* workout—including warm-up, work intervals, recovery,
and cool-down. This gives you an "overall average" that's
actually misleading!

❌ The Problem with Overall Average:
Example: 6×6 min Interval Workout
• Warm-up: 150 SPM (5 min)
• Work Interval 1: 185 SPM (6 min)
• Recovery 1: 120 SPM (2 min walking)
• Work Interval 2: 185 SPM (6 min)
• Recovery 2: 120 SPM (2 min)
• Work Interval 3: 185 SPM (6 min)
• Recovery 3: 120 SPM (2 min)
• Cool-down: 150 SPM (5 min)

Watch Average: 162 SPM ❌

This number includes your slow recovery periods and tells us
nothing about your actual running efficiency!

✅ The AKURA/AISRI Method:
We measure cadence *ONLY during work intervals* when you're
running at target intensity:

Working Cadence = (185 + 185 + 185) ÷ 3 = 185 SPM ✓

This is your TRUE performance indicator!

💡 Why This Matters:
• Recovery cadence (120-140 SPM) doesn't affect performance
• Even complete rest (0 SPM standing still) during recovery is FINE!
• We only care: "Can you maintain 180-190 SPM during work intervals?"

📊 What We Measure:
✅ Cadence during each work interval
✅ Consistency across intervals (185, 185, 185 = excellent!)
✅ Working cadence trend over weeks

❌ We ignore:
• Overall average cadence (includes recovery)
• Recovery period metrics
• Warm-up/cool-down cadence

🎯 Bottom Line:
Take complete rest during recovery if needed! Walk, stand,
stretch—whatever helps you recover. Your *working cadence*
during intervals is what predicts your running economy, injury
risk, and race performance.

Focus on maintaining 180-190 SPM during work intervals. The
rest doesn't count! 💪

## 2️⃣ General Cadence Questions

### User Asks:

- "What is optimal running cadence?"
- "How can I improve my cadence?"
- "What should my SPM be?"

### Bot Response (Abbreviated):

```
👟 Understanding Running Cadence

Cadence (steps per minute) is one of the most important
biomechanical metrics for running efficiency and injury
prevention!

🎯 Optimal Cadence Ranges:
• Elite Runners: 180-190 SPM
• Advanced: 170-180 SPM
• Intermediate: 160-170 SPM
• Beginner: 150-160 SPM

💡 Why Cadence Matters:
✅ Higher cadence = less impact per step
✅ Reduces injury risk (especially knee injuries)
✅ Improves running economy
✅ Better energy distribution

❌ Common Mistakes:
• Over-striding (too low cadence)
• Measuring cadence during recovery/walking
• Comparing easy run cadence to interval cadence

📊 How to Improve Cadence:
1️⃣ Use metronome apps (set to target SPM)
2️⃣ Focus on "quick feet" during easy runs
3️⃣ Shorten your stride slightly
4️⃣ Practice at target cadence for 1-2 min intervals

🎯 AISRI Recommendation:
Target 175-180 SPM during your regular training runs. During
intervals, 180-190 SPM is ideal!

## 3️⃣ Interval Training Methodology

### User Asks:

- "Should I walk or jog during recovery?"
- "How long should recovery periods be?"
- "Explain interval training"

### Bot Response (Abbreviated):

```
🏃‍♂️ Understanding Interval Training

Interval training is one of the most effective ways to improve
your running performance!

🎯 The Science:
Work Intervals → Stress your cardiovascular system at high intensity
Recovery Periods → Allow partial recovery while maintaining elevated HR
Repetitions → Build aerobic capacity and lactate threshold

💡 Why Recovery Matters:
• Clears lactate from muscles
• Lowers heart rate to prepare for next interval
• Prevents premature fatigue
• Allows you to maintain quality during work intervals

✅ Recovery Types:
• Active Recovery: Light jogging (140-150 SPM)
• Walking Recovery: Slow walk (120 SPM)
• Complete Rest: Standing/stretching (0 SPM)

All are valid! Choose based on your fitness level and workout
intensity.

📊 What We Analyze:
• Work interval consistency (pace, HR, cadence)
• Recovery time needed between intervals
• Overall workout quality
• Training adaptation over weeks

🎯 Key Principle:
Quality work intervals > quantity. If you need longer recovery
to maintain target pace/HR during work intervals, take it!

- "Explain running biomechanics"
- "What metrics should I track?"

### Bot Response (Abbreviated):

🔬 Running Biomechanics Analysis

AISRI analyzes your running form scientifically using key
biomechanical metrics!

📊 Key Metrics We Track:

1️⃣ Cadence (Steps Per Minute)
• Target: 180-190 SPM
• Impact: Injury prevention, efficiency

2️⃣ Vertical Oscillation
• Target: 6-8 cm
• Impact: Energy waste, running economy
• Lower = more efficient

3️⃣ Ground Contact Time
• Target: 200-250 ms
• Impact: Running power, efficiency
• Shorter = faster turnover

4️⃣ Stride Length
• Varies by pace and height
• Should increase with speed
• Avoid over-striding!

💡 Why Biomechanics Matter:
• Predict injury risk
• Improve running economy
• Optimize performance
• Identify form issues early

✅ AISRI's Approach:
We analyze these metrics during WORK intervals only, excluding
recovery periods. This gives you accurate performance indicators!

🎯 Want Your Biomechanics Report?
Upload your recent runs and I'll analyze:
• Cadence consistency
• Vertical oscillation trends
• Ground contact time
• Stride efficiency

Let's optimize your running form! 💪
